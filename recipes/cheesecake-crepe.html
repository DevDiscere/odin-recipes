        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A perfect breakfast treat for brunches, Valentine's Day, breakfast in bed, or Mother's Day.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1(8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mixed frozen berries, slightly thawed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioner's sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the flour, milk, eggs, honey, and salt in a bowl to make a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 table spoon of butter in a nonstick crepe pan over medium heat until the foam disappears. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, and swirl to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of batter. Cook until the crepe is no longer runny, about 1 minute; flip and cook the other side for an additional 1 minute. Repeat with additional butter and crepe mix, to make 4 crepes. Set the crepes aside on paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the cream cheese with 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar to make a creamy spread. Very gently stir in the berries. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the crepes and roll up. Refrigerate until chilled; slice in 1-inch sections to serve.</li>
        </ol>
